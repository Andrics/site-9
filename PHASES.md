# SITE-9 — Phases

One file. UNIT-1 and the Project agent (THE OVERSEER) both read and update
this directly — don't split status/tasks back out into separate files.

## How this actually works

Nothing below is a finished spec. Design decisions here are personal, not
generic best-practice — so the agent's job at each phase is to **ask what's
wanted**, then build it, not to build from an assumed answer. If a phase
below has blanks or open questions, that's intentional: they get filled in
through conversation, not pre-decided.

Beyond asking, non-trivial work also goes through a **plan → review → go**
loop before execution — see the Workflow section in `AGENTS.md`. UNIT-1
proposes a plan, the user relays it to the Project chat for review, and
work only starts once that review comes back with a go-ahead.

## Status

| # | Phase | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| 0 | Waybar — functional baseline (modules/layout) | Done |
| 1 | Waybar — Half-Life / Black Mesa restyle | In progress |
| 2 | System theme (GTK/icons/cursor/terminal/file manager) | Not started |
| 3 | Shell polish (fuzzel/mako/hyprlock) | Not started |
| 4 | Motion (Hyprland animations/window rules) | Not started |
| 5 | Login screen (optional — gated on whether a display manager exists) | Not started |

## Phase 1 — Waybar restyle

Goal: match the **Half-Life / Black Mesa** direction (see `BUILD_SPEC.md`
§3) — replacing the old placeholder "generic dark minimal" styling, not
just building on top of it.

**Decided so far:**
- Color direction: fusion — HEV-style green as primary accent, Black Mesa
  institutional olive/tan as the structural base. Full palette locked in
  `BUILD_SPEC.md` §3.
- Corners/borders: fully sharp, 0px radius, hard 1px borders throughout.
- Module display: icons + short HUD-style text labels (e.g. `VOL 45%`,
  `NET 82%`, `PWR 100%`), not icon-only.
- Font: JetBrains Mono Nerd Font (already installed) — open to swapping
  for something grittier (Departure Mono) later if it doesn't read well
  at bar scale.
- Bar shape: full-width, flush to the screen edge, no floating rounded
  pill — reads more like an institutional control panel.
- Applied to waybar (`waybar/.config/waybar/`) — needs to be seen live on
  the actual screen and confirmed before calling this phase done.

**Still open:**
- Confirm the palette actually looks right on-screen (colors read
  differently on the real display than in a spec doc). Now unblocked —
  scale is fixed to 1x and the restyle is actually deployed live (see
  Log). This is the last item before Phase 1 can be marked done, and
  it's a user call (UNIT-1 can't see the physical screen).
- Font rendering check at bar-scale text size — same, do this now.

**Resolved:**
- Fractional-scale conflict (scale was 1.5, `BUILD_SPEC.md` §2 requires
  integer only): user fixed directly, `scale = "auto"` → `scale = "1"`
  in `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua`, confirmed live via `hyprctl monitors`
  (`1920x1080@60Hz`, `scale: 1`).

## Phase 2 — System theme
Not scoped. Once Phase 1's palette is locked, ask what "system theme"
should actually cover before proposing anything — don't assume GTK/icon
theme scope carries over automatically.

## Phase 3 — Shell polish
Not scoped.

## Phase 4 — Motion
Not scoped. `BUILD_SPEC.md` §2 performance constraints still govern
whatever gets decided here.

## Phase 5 — Login screen
Gated: confirm a display manager is actually installed/wanted before
scoping this at all — user may be starting Hyprland by hand from a TTY.

## Log

_(newest first, short entries)_

- 2026-09-21 — **Phase 1 restyle actually deployed live** (it wasn't
  before — see below). Backed up the pre-existing
  `~/.config/waybar/{config.jsonc,style.css}` to `*.pre-stow.bak`, then
  `stow waybar`. First attempt used the default target and silently
  linked to `~/Development/.config` instead of `~/.config`, because this
  repo lives at `~/Development/site-9`, not `~/site-9` as the README's
  quickstart example assumes — parent-dir-as-target only works from the
  latter. Corrected with `stow -t ~ waybar`; symlinks now land correctly
  in `~/.config/waybar/`. **Note for next stow invocation (hypr package,
  etc.): use `stow -t ~ <package>` from this repo's actual location, not
  bare `stow <package>`.** Restarted waybar to load the new config —
  confirmed via its log it's reading from the symlinked path, no errors.
  Also confirmed user's own fix for the scale-1.5 blocker is live
  (`hyprctl monitors` shows `scale: 1`). Phase 1's restyle (palette,
  shape, `VOL`/`NET`/`PWR` labels, `vfr: true`) is now genuinely visible
  on-screen for the first time — before this, the repo had the new
  styling but the live bar was still running the old placeholder config
  since it was never stowed.
- 2026-09-21 — Repo pushed to GitHub: `github.com/Andrics/site-9` (public).
  SSH key generated and added to the GitHub account; repo scanned for
  secrets before going public (clean — only `.gitignore` rules and the
  word "token" in a design-tokens table). `origin` remote set, both
  commits pushed, `main` tracks `origin/main`.
- 2026-09-21 — Repo git-initialized (was a plain directory until now,
  despite AGENTS.md/README assuming commit-as-you-go) and initial commit
  made capturing existing state. `BUILD_SPEC.md` §1 hardware section
  filled in with verified values (i7-8650U, UHD 620, 15Gi RAM,
  1920x1080@60Hz, kernel 6.18.52-1-lts, Hyprland 0.56.2). Added missing
  `"vfr": true` to waybar config (restates already-locked constraint).
  Found live scale=1.5 conflict with the integer-scale rule — user chose
  scale 1x; not yet applied, see Phase 1 "Still open."
- 2026-09-20 — Phase 1 palette/shape/font decided (see Phase 1 section
  above) and applied to waybar. Not yet confirmed live on-screen.
- 2026-09-20 — Consolidated `PHASES.md` + `phases/*.md` into this single
  file. Corrected direction: theme is Half-Life / Black Mesa, not generic
  dark minimal — `BUILD_SPEC.md` §3 updated to match, palette left open
  for Phase 1 questions rather than pre-decided.
